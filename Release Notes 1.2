 jclazz 1.2 Release
--------------------

Release Date: 15 March, 2009

This is the release of jclazz version 1.2. It includes the following
utlities: Java Class Info, Java Decompiler + GUI

Changes made comparing to previous version see in Changelog file.

jclazz core and applications support Java6.
Currently following functionality is missing for:
   Core:
      - wide opcode supports only iinc opcode
   Java Decompiler:
      - Annotations are not supported
      - Some Java5 features are not supported in produced output files:
           - Autoboxing
           - "for each" loops
           - static import

Known bugs:
 - using "while (true)" constructions are often not correctly interpreted by decompiler, so the output may be invalid.

 --- IMPORTANT ! ---

Some decompiled files may be erroneously considered invalid. Known cases are:
 - Some if-else constructions (often inside loops with break and continue operators) 
   may not correspond to the original constructions, but logic is just the same.
 - For Java5 and higher classes when using generics cause decompiler to use class 
   casts. This is not bug as JVM does not support generics (This is Java language
   extension and used by compilers only).
 - Using constants may result in decompiled file will not use these constants.

Thanks to Janel sourceforge project for providing windows executable for running jclazz GUI: http://sourceforge.net/projects/janel/
