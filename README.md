# Jclazz original

This repo is made from releases provided by original author of jclazz and code from unreleased 1.2.3 version

## Compilation

This project is build from Netbeans, which is known to misuse ant generating IDE dependent ant builds.

Install it and compile from command line with [build.sh](https://github.com/albfan/jclazz-original/blob/master/build.sh) provided script and run with:

- [gui.sh](https://github.com/albfan/jclazz-original/blob/master/gui.sh) GUI jclazz
- [decompiler.sh](https://github.com/albfan/jclazz-original/blob/master/decompiler.sh) command line decompiler
- [infoj.sh](https://github.com/albfan/jclazz-original/blob/master/infoj.sh) command line class info
